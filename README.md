# da6401_assignment3
The goal of this assignment is fourfold: (i) learn how to model sequence to sequence learning problems using Recurrent Neural Networks (ii) compare different cells such as vanilla RNN, LSTM and GRU (iii) understand how attention networks overcome the limitations of vanilla seq2seq models.
